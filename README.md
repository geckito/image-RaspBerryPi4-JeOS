JeOS Raspberry Pi4
==================

This image is based on the JeOS image.

zypper package management is available here for installing or
update packages. Therefore the image is relative large.

Build it using with enough disk space for the build env:

```shell
 # pbuild --vm-disk-size 8000
```

This will grab 8GB disk space
